Sentinel Engine — Governance Layer Validation Report
====================================================

Author: Gopal Khandare
System: Sentinel Engine
Category: LLM Governance Layer
Deployment: Production (Render)
Date: February 2026


Objective
---------

The objective of Sentinel Engine is to introduce a deterministic governance layer
between application systems and Large Language Models, with the goal of reducing
hallucination risk, controlling inference cost, and improving operational reliability.

This layer enforces routing, refusal, cost estimation, and audit logging before any
model response is returned to the application.


Baseline Model Behavior
-----------------------

Test Environment:
Model: gpt-4o-mini
Queries: 240
Context: Intentionally incomplete

Observed behavior:

Fabrications: 160
Fabrication Rate: 66.67%

The baseline model generated confident responses even when the required information
was absent from the provided context.

This confirms the absence of built-in grounding enforcement in standard model execution.


Sentinel Engine Behavior
------------------------

Test Environment:
Same dataset, same model, same deployment conditions.

Observed behavior:

Correct Answers: 80
Correct Refusals: 160
Fabrications: 0
Fabrication Rate: 0.00%

Sentinel Engine successfully prevented all hallucinated responses by enforcing
confidence-based refusal.


Routing Validation
------------------

Routing tests were executed using mixed workloads designed to trigger both cheap
and premium model paths.

Results:

Cheap model usage: 50%
Premium model usage: 50%
Routing accuracy: 100%

Routing decisions were fully deterministic and aligned with configured thresholds.


Latency Impact
--------------

Baseline P95 latency: 1571 ms
Sentinel P95 latency: 1462 ms

Governance enforcement did not introduce measurable latency overhead.

Routing and refusal logic executed within acceptable production bounds.


Cost Impact
-----------

Sentinel cost per 100 queries: $0.0303

Routing ensured that cheap models handled low-risk queries while reserving premium
models for complex workloads.

This demonstrates cost control without sacrificing safety.


Audit Logging
-------------

Every request was logged with:

- timestamp
- model used
- token counts
- latency
- refusal flag
- estimated cost
- actual cost

This enables complete traceability of model behavior.


Conclusion
----------

Sentinel Engine successfully demonstrated the ability to:

- eliminate hallucinations under incomplete context
- enforce deterministic model routing
- maintain predictable inference costs
- provide full auditability of model execution

The system introduces governance guarantees that do not exist in baseline model usage.

This architecture is suitable for integration in production systems where reliability,
traceability, and cost control are required.
