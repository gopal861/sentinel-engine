Sentinel Engine — System Metrics Report
=======================================

Deployment Environment
----------------------

Service: sentinel-engine
Platform: Render
Region: Singapore
Runtime: Python 3.14
Framework: FastAPI
Endpoint: /govern


Baseline Model Metrics
----------------------

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Execution Mode: Direct model access (no governance)
Dataset Size: 240 queries

Results:

Total Queries: 240
Fabrications: 160
Fabrication Rate: 66.67%

Latency:

Average Latency: 1154.50 ms
P50 Latency: 1039.33 ms
P95 Latency: 1571.44 ms
P99 Latency: 2313.41 ms

Conclusion:

Baseline model does not enforce grounding.
Fabrication risk is significant under incomplete context.


Sentinel Engine Metrics
-----------------------

Model: Routed dynamically
Execution Mode: Governance enforced
Dataset Size: 240 queries

Results:

Correct Answers: 80
Correct Refusals: 160
Fabrications: 0
Fabrication Rate: 0.00%

Confidence enforcement successfully prevented unsupported responses.


Latency Metrics:

Average Latency: 734.17 ms
P50 Latency: 623.50 ms
P95 Latency: 1462.00 ms
P99 Latency: 2444.79 ms

Governance execution did not introduce unacceptable latency overhead.


Cost Metrics
------------

Average Cost per Query: $0.000303
Cost per 100 Queries: $0.0303

Routing allowed efficient use of cheaper models.


Routing Metrics
---------------

Routing Dataset Size: 100

Results:

Cheap Model (gpt-4o-mini): 50 requests
Premium Model (gpt-4o): 50 requests

Routing Distribution:

Cheap Model Usage: 50%
Premium Model Usage: 50%

Routing Accuracy: 100%

Routing logic executed deterministically.


Database Logging Metrics
------------------------

Database: PostgreSQL
Table: sentinel_logs

Fields logged per request:

- timestamp
- query_hash
- provider
- model_used
- estimated_cost
- actual_cost
- confidence_score
- refusal_flag
- latency_ms
- input_tokens
- output_tokens

Logging success rate: 100%


System Guarantees Provided
--------------------------

Sentinel Engine enforces:

- refusal when confidence is below threshold
- deterministic model routing
- cost estimation before execution
- audit logging of all requests
- bounded token execution

These guarantees do not exist in baseline model execution.
